In order to answer one of the key questions, we intended to visualize the trends in web traffic when there were exhibit events. We were able to get information about events in past ten years and classified the events as physical exhibits and poster events. The two datasets used for this visualization were combined using inner join in Tableau. There is clearly a correlation between events and web traffic as well as total data acccessed by the users. Physical events tend to affect web traffic by a significant amount and duration of the events plays a role as well.
