\begin{abstract}

The \textit{Places and Spaces: Mapping Science} exhibit introduces science mapping techniques to the general public and to experts across disciplines for educational, scientific, and practical purposes. The exhibit website \textit{www.scimaps.org} provides information about people behind the exhibit; showcases maps and macroscopes; lists past, present and planned exhibit venues and dates. The website underwent a redesign in 2015 to update the organization and user interface of the website and this study aims to analyze and visualize the changes in behaviour of users of the website due to the redesign. After scraping raw data off of monthly website usage reports in HTML format and cleaning and trasnforming it into usable format, Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard that would allow a user to gather insights from a number of visualizations. The dashboard allows a user to analyze the data from a high level as well as to drill down into details if required. Several interesting insights that were uncovered using the dashboard are presented.
