\section{Client Requirements and Visualization Goals} \label{requirements}
 The intent of the client was to understand how the website is used in order to understand the audience and also to quantify the impact of the website. The requirements from the client helped us direct our analysis and visualizations towards answering below key questions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item What is the geographic origin of the users? \item Are the majority of the users humans or crawlers and search engines?
 \item Is there a correlation between events and web-site traffic?
 \item Are users downloading content, if so, what are they downloading?
 \item What are users searching for? 
 \end{itemize}
Each of the visualizations we created provides insights that enable a user to answer a specific question. We attempted to make each visualization as interactive as possible and visually pleasing while conveying information in the best way possible.
