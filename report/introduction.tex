\section{Introduction} \label{intro}

The \textit{Places and Spaces: Mapping Science} exhibit works towards the goal of bringing maps of science and macroscopes to the general public.The website which acts as a source of information about the exhibit has a visitor base aross the globe and hosts a lot of informational content; videos, games and many science maps. Visualizing the information in Webalyzer monthly usage reports for ten years through an interactive dashboard would provide insights about the chnages in web traffic on the website after it was redesigned. Python was chosen as a tool to scrape the data from 120 HTML files and and seggregate it into a set of tables which would then be used to create visualizations. The visualizations include descriptive statistics of visitor demographics, page visits, content downloads; geospatial origin of visits; correlation between exhibit events and user activity.
