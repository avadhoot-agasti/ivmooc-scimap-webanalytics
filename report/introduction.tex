\section{Introduction} \label{intro}

The \textit{Places and Spaces: Mapping Science} exhibit works towards the goal of bringing maps of science and macroscopes to the general public.The website which acts as a source of information about the exhibit has a visitor base aross the globe and hosts a lot of informational content; videos, games and many science maps. After scraping raw data off of monthly website usage reports in HTML format and cleaning and trasnforming it into usable format, Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard that would allow a user to gather insights from a number of visualizations. The dashboard allows a user to analyze the data from a high level as well as to drill down into details if required. Several interesting insights that were uncovered using the dashboard are presented.
